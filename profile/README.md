## ðŸ“– About

This repository handles all front-end development for the LiveTune platform.

### ðŸŽ§ What is LiveTune?

**LiveTune** is a web application that lets you **listen to music in real time together with your friends**, no matter where they are. Think of it as a virtual room where music plays **in perfect sync** for all participants â€” just like being in the same space.

Whether you're hanging out, studying, or just vibing, LiveTune ensures that everyone hears the **same song at the same moment**. Combine that with **chat features**, a **shared queue**, and an engaging UI, and youâ€™ve got a social music experience designed for real-time connection.
